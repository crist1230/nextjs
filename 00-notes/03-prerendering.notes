- Nextjs automatically prerenders all pages that have no dynamic data

== getStaticProps ==
    - only used in page components
    - will execute code before prerendering page (so you can get info from the db)

    - instead of using useEffect to call from the db, use this function and call before
      the prerender

    - runs before component function runs

    - when you add this function to a file, you tell nextjs you want to prerender it

== STATIC GENERATION == 
    - generates the html without any dynamic data

    - incremental static generation === regenerates after a certain amount of time
      without needing to deploy again (during development, the number doesn't matter,
      the page will regenerate every time there's a request, during production, the
      page will only regenerate after the time has past)
    
    - dynamic pages aren't generated by default
