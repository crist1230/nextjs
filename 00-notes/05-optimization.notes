- metadata is data that gives information about other data

- Image from 'next/image' is better than <img>
    - it will automatically reformat the image file type to whatever the browser
      optimizes the best
    - it will only render images that are visible, reducing the number or requests
      made and the bandwidth
    - the width and height will be overridden with the css styling, but those
      attributes just tell next js what size to fetch the images in
