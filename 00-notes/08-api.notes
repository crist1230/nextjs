- api = Application Programing Interface

- REST API = Representation State Transfer

- in NextJS, anything in that pages/api route folder won't be seen by the client and gets executed on the server

- when you're using getStaticProps(), it's fine to use fetch to call from a third party api, but don't fetch an 
  HTTP request from your own api routes, just utiliaze the same functions over in the getStaticProps as you would
  the fetch
